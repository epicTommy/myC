This program takes in 5 integers from the user and prints the mean, median, and mode.

The mean was calculated by adding the five integers and dividing the sum by five.
The median was found after sorting the five user inputs using the bubble sorting method.
The mode was found by using a for loop to find which number has the most occurance. If there was no number with the most occurance, the program says that there is no mode.
